Manual Installation

1\. Clone the repository:

git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
2\. Optionally, backup your existing ~/.zshrc file:

cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig
3\. Create a new zsh configuration file

You can create a new zsh config file by copying the template that we included for you.

cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
4\. Change your default shell

chsh -s /bin/zsh
5\. Initialize your new zsh configuration

Once you open up a new terminal window, it should load zsh with Oh My Zsh's configuration.
